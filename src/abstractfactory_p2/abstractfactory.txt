Abstract factory is
- it lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes
- is a factory of factories
- it provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories that have a common theme
- it instantiates a concrete factory and then create products using the factory

How it works:
- products
    - product_1
        - <<product_1>> (which is interface)
            - Example: Button
        - family of product_1 (which are concrete classes and implement the interface)
            - Windows Button
            - MacOs Button
            - Linux Button
        - factories:
            - <<General factory>> which is an interface
            - family of product_1 factories (which implement the General factory and instantiate the concrete 
            class family of product_1)
                Example:
                    - Windows factory
                    - MacOs factory
    - Client app
        - just uses the General factory that instantiate the family of product_1 factory 
        and in return they instantiate the family of product_1 concrete classes
